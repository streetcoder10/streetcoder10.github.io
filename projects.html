                  <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>This was my Capstone project for Marshall University Computer Science department. The project was designed and developed by a team of 7 members. The essence of the project is to create a project that
                    can be used by the University to conduct programming contests for High School Students. The contest will be announced on the website. Teachers can register teams of students for their school. Once registered the details
                    of the contest will be provided to the teachers. The teams will be given time to work on their projects for a predetermined period (could be a semester or an academic year).
                    Once the students are satisfied with their results they can acknowledge their respective teachers about completion. The teachers can then submit the project files for review.
                    The submitted files will be assigned to University selected judges for grading and remarks. Once grading has been completed the University will post the leaderboards on the contest website. The leaderboard will contain information
                    on how the project was graded and what could be done to improve. The top 3 projects will be recognised by the Univeristy and awarded on campus.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>This is the project I'm working on currently. The game is developed using HTML5/CSS3 and PhaserJS game development framework. The Objective of the game
                      is simple, collect all the stars and avoid the fiery volcanos. The game runs on the browser and unfortunately, as of now the browser needs to be refreshed to play again.
                      However, I plan to add more challenging environments and make it a multi-level game with more options to explore and support for mobile devices. Enjoy!</p>

                      <h3>Description</h3>
                      <p>Bootstrap was the first responsive framework I learned. It was amazing to see how much the framework transformed my portfolio from messed up layouts in different screen sizes to responsive layouts
                        that gave smooth transitions of viewing on different devices. And all of it was done in a day's with fresh knowledge of the concept and understanding the grid system. I am currently working on migrating all the data into an AngularJS application
                        to include more features and better effects. Responsive design is one of the most simple yet highly regarded areas of web-development is an understatement. I hope you enjoy the portfolio as much I enjoyed developing it. </p>

                          <h3>Description</h3>
                          <p>I built my own version of the famous Arduino Car. The car has hardware from Sparkfun technologies. The car has a proximity and IR sensor array for obstacle detection. The car has temperature, humidity, dew, heat, pressure and
                            light detection sensors. The car has a live HD camera that feeds wirelessly to a display. The car has a Wi-Fi shield and Bluetooth module for connectivity. The car is connected to the IBM bluemix cloud for publishing live sensor data in JSON format.
                            This was achieved with the help of the IBM bluemix quick start recipe which enables any device to get registered to the cloud and publish available data instantly.</p>
